This program reconstructs the original set of numbers from a given set of partial sums using a backtracking algorithm.
It reads the instance from a file, calculates how many elements should be in the original set, and then attempts to find them by checking possible combinations.
If a valid set is found, it is printed as the result along with the execution time; otherwise, a message about the lack of solution is displayed.
